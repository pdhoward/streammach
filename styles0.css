 * Hey. My name is Patrick Howard. I'm the Founder of Strategic Machines and a
 * a contributor to Industry best practices in edge computing and low latency business networks. 
 * This has included novel ways for businesses to engage with their customers through location-based
 * services. By the way, before my current ventures, I helped large enterprises drive remarkable
 * productivity in project delivery through their software teams. You can read more about that
 * in two whitepapers that are available in my LinkedIn account,
 *
 * At Strategic Machines, we are applying cool and contemporary practices in customer engagement.
 *
 * In the digital age, customer engagement requires transparency, speed and intelligent interactions.
 * We learned first-hand the powerful impact of time-based competition in software delivery. These same 
 * principles and outcomes apply in serving customers through precision messaging that takes advantage
 * of context of their environment. Intrigued? Please see my blog. 
 *
 * How about some live coding?
